🖥️ How It Works
The Remote Access Tool Builder is designed to be an easy-to-use and powerful tool for generating Python code that can gather a variety of system-related data. The tool's interface allows you to select different features that you want to include in your script, then generate the corresponding Python code that is ready to run. Here’s a more in-depth breakdown of how the tool works:

1. 🔑 Enter Your Webhook URL
When you first open the tool, you’ll be prompted to enter your Discord webhook URL in a text field at the top of the GUI.

The webhook URL is where the generated data will be sent. You can get this URL from your Discord channel by creating a webhook (refer to Discord’s documentation for more details on how to create one).

This URL allows your script to automatically send collected information (such as system details, Discord tokens, cookies, etc.) directly to a Discord channel.

2. ✅ Select Features to Include
Once you have entered your webhook URL, you can select the features you want to include in your generated Python script. The following features are available:

💻 System Info: Retrieves important system-related details such as your operating system, version, architecture, IP address, and hostname.

🔑 Discord Tokens: Gathers locally stored Discord tokens. This includes user authentication tokens, which can be useful for automation or managing multiple accounts.

🍪 Cookies: Retrieves cookies stored in browsers or other applications for Discord. Cookies are small pieces of data stored to help websites recognize you.

🎮 Minecraft Info: Retrieves details about the Minecraft installation directory, which could be helpful for game automation or modding.

🔫 Valorant Info: Retrieves the installation directory for Valorant, which could help with automated configurations or modding for Valorant players.

Each feature has a corresponding checkbox. Simply check the boxes of the features you want to include in your Python script.

3. ⚙️ Build the Script
After selecting your features, click the Build button. This triggers the tool to compile the selected features and generate the Python code.

The tool dynamically creates a Python script that includes only the features you’ve selected, along with the necessary functions to retrieve that data and send it to your Discord webhook.

The Build button compiles the code based on your selections and displays it in the output box. You will see the complete Python script in the output section of the GUI.

4. 📋 Review and Customize the Generated Code
The generated Python code is fully customizable. Once the script is built, you can copy it from the output box and save it on your computer.

You can modify or extend the code as needed. For example:

You can adjust how the data is formatted before it’s sent to Discord.

Add additional logging or error handling.

Integrate other libraries or APIs to extend the functionality.

The script already includes placeholders for the webhook URL, and the code is structured to ensure that it works out-of-the-box for your selected features.

5. 🏃‍♂️ Run the Python Script
After reviewing and possibly modifying the generated code, you can run the script by opening a terminal or command prompt and executing:

bash
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
python generated_script.py
The script will retrieve the requested information (based on the features you selected) and send it to your Discord channel via the webhook URL.

6. 📲 Receive Data in Discord
Once the script is run, the data will be sent directly to your Discord webhook, and you’ll see it appear in the designated channel.

For example, you might receive a message like this:

markdown

### **System Information** 👿
**OS:** Windows 🖥️
**OS Version:** 10.0.19042 🖥️
**Architecture:** 64-bit 🖥️
**Hostname:** DESKTOP-XYZ 🖥️
**IP Address:** 192.168.1.1 🖥️

### **Discord Tokens** 🔑
`mfa.abc123xyz`

### **Cookies** 🍪
**discord.com:** `session=abcxyz`
This makes it easy to quickly access the data you need, especially in environments where you want to gather or monitor system information in real-time.

7. 🛠️ Additional Customization
You can easily modify the generated script to fit specific use cases, such as:

Sending messages to multiple Discord channels or webhooks.

Adding more detailed system data (such as CPU usage or memory usage).

Scheduling the script to run periodically, collecting data at regular intervals.

Extending the functionality to support additional features like game logs or browser information.

8. 💡 Ready to Use for Developers
The generated Python script is highly modular and can be easily adapted for other types of automation, system monitoring, or data collection.

Developers can integrate this script into larger systems or use it as part of a broader toolset for managing multiple machines or monitoring Discord accounts.
